   Computes the Average Directional Index (ADX).

   The Average Directional Index (ADX) is a technical indicator that measures the
   strength of a trend. It is based on the difference between the highest and lowest
   prices over a given period of time. The ADX is calculated as the absolute value of
   the difference between the highest and lowest prices divided by the sum of the
   absolute values of the differences between consecutive prices.

   .. attribute:: timeperiod

      The number of periods to use for the calculation of the ADX.

      :type: int


   .. py:attribute:: timeperiod
      :type:  pydantic.PositiveInt
      :value: None



   .. py:method:: compute(high, low, close)

      Computes the Average Directional Index (ADX) for a given set of high, low,
      and close price data.

      :param high: An array of high prices.
      :type high: Array
      :param low: An array of low prices.
      :type low: Array
      :param close: An array of close prices.
      :type close: Array

      :returns: A list of namedtuples containing the computed ADX values.
      :rtype: STOCH_Return



   .. py:method:: _(high, low, close)

      Computes the Average Directional Index (ADX) using high, low, and close
      price data records.

      :param high: A record containing high prices.
      :type high: Record
      :param low: A record containing low prices.
      :type low: Record
      :param close: A record containing close prices.
      :type close: Record

      :returns: A list of namedtuples containing the computed ADX values.
      :rtype: STOCH_Return
